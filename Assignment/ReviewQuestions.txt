//Q1
  THe two kinds of sivision are integer division, which dicards any remainde, and floating-point division, which yields a floating-point result(with a fractional part, if necessary). Floating-point division is performed if both operands are integers.

//Q2
  False is 0. Any number(without 0)is true.
The built-in operators <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||, and ! always generate 0 for false and 1 for true. 

//3
  Terminating declarations, terminating statements, and separating the three control expressions in a for loop.

//4
 int i =0;
 while(i<10){
             printf("i is %d\n",i);
             i = i+1;
            }

//5
1(true)

//6
If T is greater than or equal to 32 and less than 212.

//7
It would print "yes", since x is nonzero.
