//Q1
// The extra step we take is adding 1 to our complemented(flipping bits)number.
A good way to remember this is to compare the names of the representation schemes. 2's complement exceeds 1's complement by 1, so we always add 1 to our complemented numbers when using 2's complement.

//Q2
  A1:10111 A2:10101 A3:11001 A4:11111
 
//Q3
  only 1

//Q4
  The advantage of 2's complement over 1's complement is that 2's complement only has 1 value for zero. 1's complement has a "positive 0" and a "negative" 0.

//Q5
  Change 7 to simply  binary number 00111 

//Q6
  First change the number 7 to binary number 00111, and then add 1.

//Q7
 1: If the number is postive, simply convert it to binary.
 2:If the number is negative, write the positive value of the number in binary.
 3.Reverse each bit.
 4:Add 1 to the complemented number.
//Q8
 1:110000
 2:001101
 3:111101
 4:110110
 5:011010
 6:100001
